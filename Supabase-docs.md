# Supabase notes

## Auth docs
- https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth

Two parts to Auth system 
1. Authetication (should someone be allowed in, and who are they?)
2. Authorisation (what are they allowed to do?)

- thirdparty providers allowed
- sign in with [enterprise SSO](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml) (terminologies at the bottom)
- environment var: name/value pair that can affect the way running processes or programs behave on a computer
